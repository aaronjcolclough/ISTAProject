# ISTA Project

## Step 1

#### Introduction
I have been extremely interested in technology, both hardware and software, my entire life. The only real experience I have gained over the years comes from my personal "tinkering" with computers and programs, performing upgrades, trying new things, and getting to the internal pieces to discover how things work. As you can imagine, the last 10 years of being an Army Infantryman have done little to foreword progress my skills and abilities when it comes to the IT world. It has, however, ingrained in me an ability to work through difficult problems and find a working solution, even if I don't have a high level of knowledge on the topic. This project has the ability to help hone the skills one would need to vault into the software development. I feel the understanding of databases, how online stores function, and the processes it takes to develop games are a good starting point to gain the experience needed to help find a career in software development.

#### Body

###### First Project Review (Database GUI)
After the first week of classes, it would appear that all software generally runs in conjunction with the use databases. Gaining a base knowledge of how to develop an extensive database and link it to an interactive system that an end user can easily access the information would be an exquisite starting point for future projects. I am considering database of Army knowledge and Promotion Board questions that would be presented in a GUI with a visual similar to note cards. The system would draw on the database and populate one question at a time from the category the user selected. The answer can be revealed by clicking/tapping on the note card (which would then flip over to show the answer). I would also add a feature allowing the user to add their own knowledge and question to the "deck" or remove information they feel is not needed.

###### Second Project Review (Online Store/Auction System)
In the digital age, online hopping has become the norm across the world. Understanding the basic fundamentals that go into creating a marketplace style shopping system could potentially pave the way to future employment with companies like Amazon and eBay. One of the new "fads" is cryptocurrency; designing a system that involves the buy and selling of the various currencies could be a not only a very appealing idea to the average consumer, but would also incorporate a new aspect that current models don't necessarily use. The marketplace would require an up-datable database with the current market rates for the currency, different modules for the assorted users, transaction and payment modules, and a communications module that would allow for a connection between users.

###### Third Project Review (Strategy Game)
Last year, over 500 brand new mobile games were launched in the Apple Store each day. The gaming industry is a multi-billion dollar "cash cow" and is showing zero signs of slowing its growth rate. Getting "hands-on" experience creating a game would put me in a great position when it comes to pursuing a career in development. Some sources place the number of mobile game development companies ant nearly 100,000 which means there are a lot of jobs in this sector. Understanding the needs of creating not only the databases needed to run the game, but learning how to create a random generator and logic engine that will make the game more interesting would place me in a better category when being looked at by potential employers.

#### Conclusion
In considering my options for a project to help propel my future, I realize I have a lot of work to do. Databases seem to be a large part in all things software and it would be foolish of me not to deepen my knowledge on the subject; the same goes for Graphical User Interfaces when it comes to the end user. Regardless of the project I choose to create, the skills and experience gained from it will be invaluable when it comes to my future career. Those skills will be able to be applied in a multitude of different applications, so long as, I take the time and exert the effort to learn them.

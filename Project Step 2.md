## Step 2

#### Introduction
After the first 2 weeks of class, it would appear that all software generally runs in conjunction with the use of databases. Gaining a base knowledge of how to develop an extensive database and link it to an interactive system that an end user can easily access the information would be an exquisite starting point for future projects. I have chosen to create a database of Army knowledge and Promotion Board questions that would be presented in a GUI with a visual similar to note cards. 

#### Body

###### Database
The database is going to contain one main category of information; knowledge. Keeping it simple and not requiring log in credentials, I will focus on the following categories:

- Weapon's Data
- Military Justice
- Wear and Appearance of Uniforms
- Customs and Courtesies
- Military Programs
- Leadership
- Basic Soldier Skills

I would also like to have a library of useful Field Manuals that the user can access. An ability to keep track of the questions the user has already answered could also be helpful.

###### Programming
The program will need to process commands which allow for the retrieval, addition, and deletion of the stored data inside the database. The GUI will need to allow for processing of clicks and/or taps.

###### Interface
The graphical user interface will have multiple pages. The main one of which will be a menu page featuring click-able options for specific categories of questions, an all categories selection and an add category/question selection. Each of those buttons will then take the user to another page displaying subcategory selections. After the user chooses which category he/she would like to study, a simple note card will be displayed with the question on it. The answer can be revealed by simply tapping or clicking on the card, causing it to flip over. The FM library will be some sort of PDF viewer where the user can scroll through the manual to study it more thoroughly.

#### Conclusion
When it comes time to build this project, I plan on building the different pieces somewhat at the same time. For instance, if I build the database(s) but only fill it with minimal data, it will facilitate building the GUI with out wasting a lot of time of something that I may have to adjust in the future. After both are complete, running, and functioning correctly I will focus on filling in the missing data and adjusting the overall look of the interfaces.
